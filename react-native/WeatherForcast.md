In this task, you're tasked to implement a mobile application where users can see the current weather and forecast in various cities.

Weather details include:

-   City Name
-   Current Temperature
-   Weather condition
-   Weather Icon
-   Humidity
-   Pressure
-   Wind Speed

Use cases: When users open the app, they see a search bar to enter the name of a city. Upon searching, the app displays the current weather and forecast for the searched city.

Technical Breakdown: Points that you MUST do:

-   You should use TDD (Test driven development) approach to implement this application. (Test first)
-   Please create a commit for each feature/page you implement with a meaningful message, Create a story of your progress!
-   Use the best practices when coding.
-   Always code with a smile :) .
-   Create awesome animations!

Bonus Points:

-   Use Shimmer effect when loading the weather data.
-   Implement a caching mechanism for offline loading.
-   Implement a feature that allows users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.

What to use? As for the technologies that you will use:

-   React Native for mobile app development
-   OpenWeather API for fetching weather data
-   Redux for state management
-   Jest for testing
-   Git for version control
-   Any other technologies that might help you.
