The fitness details to track include:

-   Exercise type

-   Calories burned
-   Goals set and achieved

Use cases: Users can log their workout activities into the app, set fitness goals, and receive notifications when goals are achieved or reminders for workouts.

Technical Breakdown: Points that you MUST do:

-   Use TDD (Test driven development) approach to implement this application.
-   Create a commit for each feature/page you implement with a meaningful message, Create a story of your progress!
-   Use the best practices when coding.
-   Always code with a smile :) .
-   Create awesome animations!

Bonus Points:

-   Use React Native's Geolocation for tracking workout routes.
-   Implement a custom native module, like a pedometer for step tracking.
-   Notifications should be implemented using React Native's Push Notification service.

What to use? As for the technologies that you will use:

-   React Native for mobile app development
-   Redux for state management
-   Jest for testing
-   Git for version control
-   Any other technologies that might help you.
