    -   Display the job's title, company, location, type, and a description.
    -   Allow users to filter results by location and job type.
    -   Display an error message if no jobs match the search criteria or if there is an error retrieving the data from the API.
    
    Requirements
    
    -   Use Angular as the front-end framework to build the app.

    -   Use NgRx to manage the state.
    -   Implement a feature that uses RxJS for handling asynchronous operations and API requests.
