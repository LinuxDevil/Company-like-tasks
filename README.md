## Introduction

Each of the tasks presented in this repository is designed to test different skills and proficiencies in React, Angular, and .NET core. They are designed in a way to demonstrate the ability to build robust, efficient and scalable applications. These tasks can be used as a way to practice these technologies, prepare for interviews, or for actual job assignments.

## Tasks

The tasks are divided into three sections each corresponding to a specific technology.

### React Tasks

The React tasks focus on building interactive and dynamic single-page applications. These tasks will test your ability to manage state, handle API requests, navigate different views, and ensure your application is responsive and user-friendly.

### Angular Tasks

The Angular tasks focus on developing dynamic applications using Angular, NgRx, and RxJS. These tasks will test your understanding of Angularâ€™s component architecture, state management with NgRx, and working with Observables with RxJS.

### .NET Tasks

The .NET tasks focus on building robust and secure back-end services with .NET Core and ASP.NET. These tasks will test your ability to create RESTful APIs, manage data using a relational database, and implement authentication and authorization.

### Spring Boot Tasks

Spring Boot tasks are included in the SpringBootTasks.md file. These tasks require knowledge of Spring Boot, various databases, and possibly other tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, Redis, and Jenkins.


### React Native Tasks

React Native tasks are in the ReactNativeTasks.md file. These tasks involve building mobile applications with various features using React Native.
