#### Requirements:

-   The calendar should display the date of the event and the title.
-   When a user clicks on a date, it should display more details about the event.
-   You should use either CSS, SASS, or Tailwind to implement the layout.

#### Bonus Tasks:

-   Add an event filtering functionality by month or event type.
-   Implement a dynamic change of days based on the selected month.
-   Provide an option for users to switch between a grid view and a list view for the events.
-   Use animations for a smooth transition when displaying event details.

#### Review Process:

Your code will be reviewed for the following:

-   Code quality: Is your code well-structured? Is your CSS/SASS/Tailwind usage correct and efficient?
-   Responsiveness: Does your layout adapt well to different screen sizes?
-   Design: Does the layout look appealing? Is the user experience smooth?
-   Documentation: Is your codebase well-documented? Does your README include how to run the project and any other necessary instructions?

Please submit your code as a GitHub repository with a README file explaining how to run the app and any additional notes you want to include.
