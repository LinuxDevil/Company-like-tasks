# Queue Reversal with Stack

### Problem:

Given a queue of integers, reverse the order of the elements in the queue using only stack operations.

### Example:

If the input queue is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, the function should return a queue with the elements in reversed order `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`.

### Tests to run:

-   Test1: Queue = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} => Expected output is `{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`.
-   Test2: Queue = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1} => Expected output is `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.
