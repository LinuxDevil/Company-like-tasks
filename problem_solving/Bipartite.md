# Bipartite Graph Checking

### Problem:

Given an undirected graph with `N` vertices and `M` edges, represented by two arrays, `R` and `S`, check whether the graph is bipartite.

### Example:

If `R = [1, 2, 3]` and `S = [2, 3, 1]`, the function should return `false`.

### Tests to run:

-   Test1: R = [1, 2, 3] and S = [2, 3, 1] => Expected output is `false`.
-   Test2: R = [1, 3, 2] and S = [2, 1, 3] => Expected output is `true`.
