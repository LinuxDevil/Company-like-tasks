# Cycle Detection in Graph

### Problem:

Given a directed graph with `N` vertices and `M` edges, described by two arrays, `P` and `Q`, check if there is a cycle in the graph.

### Example:

If `P = [1,2,3,4]` and `Q = [2,3,4,1]`, the function should return `true` because there is a cycle.

### Tests to run:

-   Test1: P = [1,2,3,4] and Q = [2,3,4,1] => Expected output is `true`.
-   Test2: P = [1,2,3,4] and Q = [2,3,1,5] => Expected output is `false`.
