2.  Get Product: Users should be able to view a product's details.
    
3.  Get All Products: Users should be able to view all products.
    

Technical Requirements:

-   Use Spring Boot to implement the backend.
-   Use Redis as a cache.
-   Use Jenkins for CI/CD.
-   The application should follow the REST architecture.
-   Write unit tests for your code using JUnit and Mockito.
-   Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for your database.
-   Use Git for version control and make sure to commit your changes regularly.

Bonus:
