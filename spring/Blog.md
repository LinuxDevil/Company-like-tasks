**Blog Post System Backend**

Project Description

You are tasked with building a simple backend for a blog post system. The system should allow users to create, update, delete, and view blog posts.

Functional Requirements:

1.  User Authentication: Implement a user registration and login system. Users should be able to register with an email and password and then login to access the other API endpoints.
    
2.  Create Blog Post: Users should be able to create a new blog post. A blog post should have a title, body, and tags.
    
3.  Update Blog Post: Users should be able to update their blog posts.
    
4.  Delete Blog Post: Users should be able to delete their blog posts.
    
5.  View Blog Posts: Users should be able to view all their blog posts.
    

Technical Requirements:

-   Use Spring Boot to implement the backend.
-   Use Spring Security for implementing user authentication.
-   Use Spring Data JPA for database operations.
-   The application should follow the REST architecture.
-   Write unit tests for your code using JUnit and Mockito.
-   Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for your database.
-   Use Git for version control and make sure to commit your changes regularly.

Bonus:

-   Implement user roles (Admin, User). Admins should be able to delete any blog post. Use Spring Security to manage the permissions.
-   Implement pagination for the view blog posts API endpoint.
-   Deploy your application to a platform like Heroku.
